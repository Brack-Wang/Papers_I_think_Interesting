## 2/25 ranking
[GRAPH-GUIDED SCENE RECONSTRUCTION FROM IMAGES WITH 3D GAUSSIAN SPLATTING](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17377)
- Optimization of 3DGS on large scene. The design of the selection of the camera pose based on graph is interesting.
- The usage of Octree is not new, but the idea of volume rendering become trend on this filed.

[DICEPTION: A Generalist Diffusion Model for Visual Perceptual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17157)
- It claim to do multi-task including depth estimation, segmentation as a foundation model. With finetune on 1% dataset, it could achieve good performance on OOD data.
- Wait for the code publish.

[DIS-CO: Discovering Copyrighted Content in VLMs Training Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17358)
- Detect whether synthesis content of VLM infringe copyright of testing data.

[TOWARDS HIERARCHICAL RECTIFIED FLOW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17436)
- A method for efficiently training generative model.
- Research in a theoretical way on 2D general images.

[CAR-LOAM: Color-Assisted Robust LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17249)
- Lidar based SLAM is longlasting and mature task.
- It occur to me that the dust3r representation is a kind of lidar（Flash Lidar， Solid-State Lidar， Directed Lidar）. Could inspired by lidar SLAM methods.

[RELICT: A Replica Detection Framework for Medical Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17360)
- As the person did medical generation, I do not like this task. But It values, protecting patients' privacy is one of reason why synthesis data required.

[Improving Monocular Visual-Inertial Initialization with Structureless Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16598)
- Monocular Visual + inertial odometry for localization, usually no odometry in 3D tasks but could be saved.
