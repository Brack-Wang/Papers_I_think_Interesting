[GRAPH-GUIDED SCENE RECONSTRUCTION FROM IMAGES WITH 3D GAUSSIAN SPLATTING](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17377)
- Optimization of 3DGS on large scene. The design of the selection of the camera pose based on graph is interesting.


[DICEPTION: A Generalist Diffusion Model for Visual Perceptual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17157)
- It claim to do multi-task including depth estimation, segmentation as a foundation model. With finetune on 1% dataset, it could achieve good performance on OOD data.
- Wait for the code publish.
