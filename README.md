[Do computer vision foundation models learn the low-level characteristics of the human visual system?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20256)
- Interesting work analysing the Vision Foundation models and human visual.
- Some conclusion below
  

| Term                           | Explanation  | Research Findings  |
|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Contrast Detection Differences** | Computer vision models have lower sensitivity to low-contrast details and show irregular responses across different spatial frequencies. | Computer vision models are less sensitive to low contrast detection and are not as stable as human vision. |
| **Contrast Masking Similarity** | In complex backgrounds, the visibility of target objects decreases, and both human and computer vision exhibit similar behavior. | The masking characteristics of DINOv2 and OpenCLIP are closely aligned with human vision. |
| **Contrast Constancy** | The human visual system maintains stable contrast perception under different lighting conditions and object sizes, while computer vision models are less stable in low-frequency regions. | DINOv2 and OpenCLIP perform well in high-frequency regions, but overall still differ from human vision. |

**other**

[rendernet](https://rendernet.ai/)
- Given image and music create movie, changing dress, the demo looks good and attracting. But I do not want to pay for trying.


**Opinions**

Current Trend: AI models for images/videos mostly use diffusion, while text models prefer autoregression.
```
Information Structure:
- Text is a sequence where each word depends on the previous one, making autoregression more natural.
- Images/videos have spatial and temporal patterns, which diffusion models handle well by refining details step by step.

Noise and Perception:
- Humans see images holistically, so diffusion can gradually remove noise to restore details.
- Text errors are discrete (e.g., typos, grammar issues), making noise removal less effective.
